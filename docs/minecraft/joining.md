# Joining a Server
!!!info Note
*You may need to setup ZeroTier in order to join certain servers.* See how to join in [ZeroTier](/other/zerotier.md).
!!!

## Connecting
- Launch Minecraft, then go to ***Multiplayer*** > ***Add Server*** or ***Direct Connect***.
- Under ***Server Address***, paste your server IP or the IP provided by the administrator. Then click ***Done***.
   - If configured properly, your client will ping the server and the MOTD will show up. *If it does not show up, ensure the server is running and that you've inputted the correct address.*

!!!warning Warning
Cracked clients can only play on servers that are in offline mode. *Servers in online mode require official accounts as they authenticate with Mojang servers.*

## Troubleshooting
If you are unable to join, confirm you have verified all of the following:

- The server is active and running
- The correct Minecraft version and modpack (if applicable)
- You have installed [additional or updated mods](/minecraft/curseforge.md#downloading-extra-mods) required by the server
- You have an official or cracked Minecraft account
- Proper [ZeroTier network configuration](/other/zerotier.md)
